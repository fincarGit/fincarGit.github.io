        <h1>shortcuts I tend to forget in spacemacs:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>!!:1 : first argument of previoyus command in shell</li>
            <li>!!:0 : first word of last previous command in shell</li>
            <li>!!:n : the n-th argument of the previous command in shell</li>
            <li>$_ : the last argument of the last previously executed command in shell</li>
            <li>_ t n : toggle line numbers</li>
            <li>_ w m : maximize current window (the other bufers will be kept open in the buffer list.</li>
            <li>_ t r : toggle relative line numbers</li>
            <li>v i g : select all</li>
            <li>_ _ clipbard-kill-ring-buffer : copy to system clipboard</li>
            <li>_ z x : scale the text as you like</li>
            <li> global-visual-line-mode : wrap each line at the end of the window, when displaying. Aka: line wrap from notepad++ </li>
            <li>_ _ ansi-term : open a terminal window in buffer (this one seems to be the most useful of the different emacs terminal options for me)</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>git commands that I tend to forget</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>git diff --cached : show a the git diff (changed lines) from the staged files and the last commit.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Every few years I need to update my os</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>in xfce I like to have a style with no borders for the windows : to achieve this one has to create the following file:/usr/share/themes/empty/xfwm4/themerc.
Here the name empty is just the name that I gave to this theme. You can name it whatever you want. Later in the settings application from xfce you can simply choose this theme and thats it. Everything you usually do with the title bar is still accesible by typing alt-space.
            </li>
        </ul>
