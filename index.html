            <li>git diff --cached : show a the git diff (changed lines) from the staged files and the last commit.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Every few years I need to update my os</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>in xfce I like to have a style with no borders for the windows : to achieve this one has to create the following file:/usr/share/themes/empty/xfwm4/themerc.
Here the name empty is just the name that I gave to this theme. You can name it whatever you want. Later in the settings application from xfce you can simply choose this theme and thats it. Everything you usually do with the title bar is still accesible by typing alt-space.
            </li>

    nmtui - a good tool to configure wifi

    How to configure the touchpad or other device with xinput:

    # figure out the device that you want to change:
    xinput list

    # list all the current settings:

    xinput list "SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad"
    # for example the scrolling distance
    xinput set-prop "SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad" "Synaptics Scrolling Distance" 350 350

    # the doc can be found here:

    command history for mounting a usb stick and then formatting it to ntfs.
y
    check if the name you want to assign in mount process is already taken:
 2825  ls /media
    annicas_stick is not taken, so proceed in creating mount point on os.
 2826  sudo mkdir /media/annicas_stick
    check how the device appears.
 2827  lsblk
 2830  df -h
    mount the device under the name that was prepared.
 2832  sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/annicas_stick
    make a validity check, that this is really the device you want to format, and that there is no data, that you want to keep:
 2835  df -H
 2836  ls /media/annicas_stick
    Finally unmount the device again.
 2841  sudo umount /dev/sdb1
    And trigger the file system formatting to ntfs. (This could take a while)
 2842  sudo mkfs.ntfs /dev/sdb1


nmcli radio wifi -- This shows if the wifi is enabled
nmcli radio wifi on -- This enables wifi
nmcli radio wifi off -- This disables wifi

nmtui -- Finally for connecting probably the easiest to use is the nmtui tool.
